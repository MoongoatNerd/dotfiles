# dotfiles

Repo for my dot files. I'd like to make it work for multiple computers and I'm not sure how I'm gonna do that yet. A branch for each? Working Trees? I dunno. If anyone has a good idea, lemme know! For now I'm only gonna slowly push things that I think will be universal across my different machines. Also gotta be careful not to dox myself... 🤣
